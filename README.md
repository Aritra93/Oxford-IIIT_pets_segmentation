# Oxford-IIIT_pets_segmentation

This repository contains two notebooks, one contains image segmentation model using SegNet architecture and another model using UNet architecture. The results of these two notebooks compares the image segmentation results from the Oxford-IIIT pets dataset. UNet clearly improves and predicts better segmentation maps justified by IoU scores.
